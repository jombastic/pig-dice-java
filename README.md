## Description

A program created with Java where a player can play with another player the Pig
dice game. If one player rolls a number bigger than 1, the player gets another turn
and the number is added to the turn score. The player than can choose if he rolls
again or if he holds, and if he chooses the later, his turn score is added to his
overall score and the other player gets a turn. If number 1 is scored instead,
the player looses his turn score and automatically is the other player's turn.
